ANALYSIS,TRENDS AND INSIGHTS
-Their is a gradual decrease of the total sales and the total number of orders as months pass by.
-Amazon recorded the channel with the most sales ,Flipkart and myntra also had a good amount 
of orders.
-Set was our most sold item, kurta had a good amount of orders but does not generate alot of income.
- Major of our customers are women and they are adults , adults have more orders compared to any other age group
.
-Despite the fact that major items are delivered their is quite a number of returned, cancelled and refunded orders.
RECOMENDATIONS
- We need to ensure more efficiency in our top delivery channels(Amazon,Flipkart,Myntra) for customers to get their items way faster , to ensure customer retention.
-Due to noticable down trends in our sales, we need to work more on finding new customers, creating product awareness, check on reduced pricing and improving quality.
-We need to stock more on women's item , concentrate more energy on our major customers , besides the normal stock that we have , we can also stock up what adult women love too.
-We need to analyze on the reason why we have cancelled , refunded and returned goods to maximize on profits and ensure customer retention.
-we need to ensure well stocked set items and kurta items since they are our most sold items,they should always be available , quality maintained at par and pricing is suitable enough for our customers.
